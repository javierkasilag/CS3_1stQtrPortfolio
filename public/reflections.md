# 5 topics I know very well
1. *Arithmetic operators:* These come off as common sense knowledge to me. I have been taught operators throughout my live, and still make use of them up to the present day.
2. *Comparison operators:* I (also) know comparison operators very well because of how essential they are and have been to most of the coding tasks I have done this year and the previous year. I do not remember a significant number of assignments that did not have comparison operators.
3. *Markdown:* I have much experience using websites that use different types special text formatting to display varied outputs, like Discord or some wikis (that use HTML!). Even if the specifics of the text editor are different from the other text editors I use, dealing with markdown files is relatively easy for me.
4. *Data types:* I do not know *all* of them, but I absolutely do know the most important ones, namely: integer, float, string, and boolean. What they are and what they are used for is ingrained in my mind.
5. *Loop control structures (while, for):* Although I *sometimes* get confused with specific instances or scenarios of loops (e.g. "what is the output of this specific loop?"), I know the logic behind the *while* and *for* operators. I survived this topic in Grade 8 when it was discussed via C++, which a lot of other people found difficult.

# 5 topics I either know but have not mastered or do not know
1. *Button input/output:* I know the basic functionalities of buttons, but it is tricky for me to memorize the full syntaxes thereof. It is hard for me to memorize such many and long parts of code, from what code to put within the button label to things like *onclick* and *id*.
2. *ComSci terminologies:* When it comes to things like the actual definitions of HTML or HTTP as acronyms, I am not too in-the-know. Most of the time, I am only aware of the fact that they exist and how they can be used, now what they actually are and why.
3. *Functions:* I get the gist of functions, but actually coding and using them can be confusing for me sometimes. This especially goes for functions that return outputs and involve passing by values from different scopes (global/local).
4. *Number properties:* What *are* number properties? I have, literally, speaking no idea.
5. *Loop control structures (do..while, for..in, etc.):* My main difficulty with the other loop control structures is that I either only know them on a very basic level (*do..while*) or do not know them at all (*everything else*). I believe it has to do with them not being talked about very much this school year and the previous ones.

# How I will master the topics I have not mastered
- I think I really just have to apply what I know more in JavaScript and coding in generalâ€”screwing around, so to speak. There are a lot of websites that offer coding tasks of varying difficulties for practice which I believe would help me.

# Activities in class I think were and were not effective
Effective...
1. *In-class coding exercises:* The learning aspect is really emphasized because we can go at our own paces for the coding exercises. There is also actual feedback possible by the presence of the teacher and seatmates.

Not effective...
1. *Kahoot:* It feels too fast-paced for actual learning. The competitiveness of the game does not help either.
2. *Speedtests:* They have the same problem as Kahoot, but to a lesser degree. There is more of an incentive to finish code first than to actually take in the logic behind the code, even if there is more learning gained than in Kahoot.
