# 5 topics I know very well
1. *Arithmetic operators:* These come off as common sense knowledge to me. I have been taught operators throughout my live, and still make use of them up to the present day.
2. *Data types:* I do not know *all* of them, but I absolutely do know the most important ones, namely: integer, float, string, and boolean. What they are and what they are used for is ingrained in my mind.
3. *Markdown:* I have much experience using websites that use different types special text formatting to display varied outputs, like Discord or some wikis (that use HTML!). Even if the specifics of the text editor are different from the other text editors I use, dealing with markdown files is relatively easy for me.

5. *Loop control structures (while, for):* Although I *sometimes* get confused with specific instances or scenarios of loops (e.g. "what is the output of this specific loop?"), I know the logic behind the *while* and *for* operators. I survived this topic in Grade 8 when it was discussed via C++, which a lot of other people found difficult.

# 5 topics I know but have not mastered
1. *Button input/output:* I know the basic functionalities of buttons, but it is tricky for me to memorize the full syntaxes thereof. It is hard for me to memorize such many and long parts of code, from what code to put within the button label to things like *onclick* and *id*.
2. *ComSci terminologies:* When it comes to things like the actual definitions of HTML or HTTP as acronyms, I am not too in-the-know. Most of the time, I am only aware of the fact that they exist and how they can be used, now what they actually are and why.
3. *Functions:* I get the gist of functions, but actually coding and using them can be confusing for me sometimes. This especially goes for functions that return outputs and involve passing by values from different scopes (global/local).
4. 
5. *Loop control structures (do..while, for..in, etc.):* My main difficulty with the other loop control structures is that I either only know them on a very basic level (*do..while*) or do not know them at all (*everything else*). I believe it has to do with them not being talked about very much this school year and the previous ones.
